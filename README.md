## Partner Workshop Submission

- Create a PR `CustomerName_YourName_ProblemStatementNumber` from `main`
- You just have to put your codes in a repo and share the repo with us. For Snap-is and ADaaS, a template repo is already shared; you just have to clone it, add your codes, and share it with us. Nothing else is needed.
  - If you want to share anything else, like a Postman API call, they can put it in the repo readme file. This is optional.

Also, Dashboard is part of Snap-in, so it doesnâ€™t need any other code repo.
Guidelines:
- You just need to share the code repo with the snap-in. The dashboard should be part of the snap-in only.
- Screenshots of the setup and documentation are not required.
- There are no additional requirements.
- You should put the code in the repo and share it with us.
